# India Model for Adaptive Comfort (IMAC) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/spandan-pandya/IMAC/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2FIMAC_Widget.ipynb)
Buildings consume 40% of the total energy generated globally. A significant proportion of this consumption is utilized in order to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures via cooling or heating. A building can be classified as being in one of the three ‘Building Operation Modes’ depending on the presence of Air Conditioning. The ‘Natural Ventilation’ mode implies the absence of Air-Conditioning as well as assisted mechanical ventilation; conversely the ‘Air Conditioned’  mode implies that comfort is achieved wholly by the use of artificial mechanisms; the ‘Mixed Mode’ of operations is a combination of the two aforementioned modes, suggesting that Air Conditioning is used over specific spaces or during certain time-periods.

Studies have shown that indoor comfort temperatures correlate strongly to outdoor weather conditions. The aim of this tool is to calculate indoor comfort temperatures or ‘Average Neutral Operative Temperatures’ for 160 Indian cities and towns and provide temperature ranges where 90% or 80% of occupants would feel comfortable in a building. This tool calculates these temperatures for commercial as well as residential buildings using a region’s Typical meteorological year (TMY) data. While the commercial building type includes three modes of operations (Naturally Ventilated, Air Conditioned, and Mixed Mode), the residential building type assumes a ‘Mix Mode’ of indoor operations. 

The tool provides a table with the calculated temperatures and ranges and provides the visualisation for the same. A user may download this calculated data in the form of a .csv file by using the ‘Download Data’ feature.
